But this is not the reason for my writing this story. The thing I noticed after that was the main issue. When we were going back to our home, roaming in streets. We found a church there, near end of the street, we always see the church, but it was looking different this time, maybe because vibes we captured before, but this much is weird. We went near church, however there was a cut for our house before church only."
